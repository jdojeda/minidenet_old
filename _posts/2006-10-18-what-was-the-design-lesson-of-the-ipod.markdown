Y Steve Jobs [responde](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/):





> Look at the design of a lot of consumer products—they're really complicated surfaces. We tried make something much more holistic and simple. When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don't put in the time or energy to get there. We believe that customers are smart, and want objects which are well thought through.





Oh, es una frase totalmente zen. Siempre intento recordármela en todo momento: _limpiar la superficie_. Como lo acaba de mencionar Steve. Todo se ve tan complejo, tan lleno de ruido visual que, con todo el cansancio que llevas día a día, pocas ganas te quedan de utilizarlo. Dame algo simple, algo que lo haga, casi todo, y de una forma amena y confortable.
