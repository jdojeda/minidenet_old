[Peter Morville](http://www.semanticstudios.com/about/morville.html) escribe otro interesante artículo en [Semantics](http://www.semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/” title=”An irregularly irreverent column<br />
about information architecture,<br />
strategy and management.<br />
) llamado [Innovation Architecture](http://www.semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/innovation.html), un pequeño quote:





> &#34;For the past decade, most of us have practiced classical information architecture. Our centralized teams and top-down methods have been aimed at the creation of stable structures.  

  

  

  

As we embrace the lessons of complex adaptive systems, we must explore the territory of post-modern innovation architecture, using bottom-up methods to incubate online ecologies and economies that exhibit the capacity to learn and evolve over time.&#34;
