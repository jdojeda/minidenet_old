Deftones es una de mis bandas favoritas. De todos los discos, el último Deftones tiene unos temas esenciales, entre ellos uno de los mejores en mi opinión: Battle-Axe.





> I want to sleep if you are awake  

Still making believe that you aren’t at all crazy  

And if you don’t believe I think you should  

You make me so proud  

Still you love to think you have always been this way… but you’re all wrong

> And you only sleep when you’ve lost cause  

Well I still believe that the cause was always me  

And if you don’t believe I think you should  

You make me so proud  

Still you love to think you have always been this way  

Well I’d love to think you will someday feel the same  

And you love to think it will always… always…  

If you still believe it wil always be this way… well you’re all wrong





Otro que está genial es: Needles and Pins.
