White trash bitch controls you  

Born and raised in a trailer park  

And all the faces of the lies surround you  

Your simple pleasures come from  

Someone else’s pain  

The way you like it  

For you  

I’ve become  

What you’ve made me  

And we make this new religion  

To escape what we’ve become  

And we make this new religion  

To escape what we’ve become  

So you played along  

You couldn’t help it  

And the followers stand in line  

I see no fading  

So lets give it one more try  

As the souls just walk right by  

To face this re-creation  

And we make this new religion  

To escape what we’ve become  

And make this new religion  

To escape what we’ve become  

And we make this new religion  

To escape what we’ve become
