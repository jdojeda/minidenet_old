Y dice…





> I’m suffering of a lonely I could find a girl that would take me away from the chaos of the city and the everyday part that I play  

tell me why lay low, why say no when I got girls serenading at my window  

Ladies good to go  

We’s Major league  

the new breed no so-so.  

Highly advanced and got the game to get in and girls Pants and romance her stone  

Cuz I more than hold my own they call me Shifty Capone  

I make them moan  

Yes, I’m the one between the sheets, I amaze and stun aiin’t no need for me to brag about the way that I’m hung  

Let’s just say I got the skills to get the flyest girl sprung  

Or to take and more  

An older lady feel young.

> Now ladies come, ladies go out my revolving door,  

some Ladies never come back,   

Most come back for more Ive got a house in the hills,  

With a door that spins,  

Goes in and out, out and in  

Round round again.
