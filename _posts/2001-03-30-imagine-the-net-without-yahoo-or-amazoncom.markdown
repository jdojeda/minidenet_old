> Fueled by a “viral lack of confidence,” the Internet economy has slipped into a recession. If this trend continues, you might soon lose access to your favorite online store, greeting card site, news source, music site or financial chat group. Imagine the Internet without Excite, Yahoo! or Amazon.com.





This words become into the most pushing event I’ve read… Since the 1ast May reboot event. But this will be do it in April 3rd.





The main concept here is buy or donate something in your popular website… This will help to grow the Internet economy a lot and help to many website survive the big wave of massive LO. I will buy a new book, I have nothing in mind yet because my amazon list is too big, but i think I’m looking for a new IA book, maybe I will buy [Information Anxiety 2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789724103/ref=cm_mp_wl/104-8517110-2334330?colid=V6NKYV747CJ1), I think it’s cheap and it has several good ratings on Amazon.com.





Going back to topic of this post “[Back the Net Day](http://www.iconocast.com/crusade/index.html)” will be reporting many things about this project.
