Para mi flor de loto:





> I feel soon  

I will sink into you  

What do you think  

&#8216;Cause there’s still blood in your hair  

And I’ve got the bruise of the year  

But there’s something about her long shady eyes  

I’m all about her shade tonight  

I hate your tatoos  

You have weak wrists  

But i’ll keep you  

Well it’s too bad  

You’re married to me
