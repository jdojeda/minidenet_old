La gente de [37signals](http://www.37signals.com) recientemente [ha mencionado el lanzamiento](http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000378.php?13#comments) de [Shopping.com](http://www.shopping.com) un sitio que antes era de Dealtime&#8482; y al parecer fue comprado por [Epinions!](http://www.epinions.com) uno de los sitios que más he admirado y aprendido del mismo.





Uno de los chicos de 37signals [JF dijo](http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000378.php?13#jf_007461):

> Colors weren’t our choice, we worked with what we were given. I agree, they are heavy, and we discussed this with the folks at Shopping.com, but they have their reasons. They do an enormous amout of user testing and all of their decisions are supported by real data. So, while I respect and understand their decision, I still think it’s too much for my tastes ;)

> RE: Tables and Font tags… We didn’t deliver code with font tags, and we tried to use CSS instead of tables wherever possible, but this is a data heavy site and when they recoded it to fit into their systems, they had to make some changes. The real world is quite different than the theoritical one. I assue you, the folks at Shopping.com are very savvy, and they “get it”–but, just like every other company, they have limited resources and have to make tradeoffs.
