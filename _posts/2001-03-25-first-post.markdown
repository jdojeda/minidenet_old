This is my first post in this domain, minid.net. It is my new home, and I hope, it will be my homepage forever. I don’t know what should I write here. I feel like empty.





Well I’m working hard to finish this site [www.livra.com](http://www.livra.com).





What’s the deal with this? Well... I’m trying to push this website like a big tool, with lot of user experience and many hours and days of research. This site works full XML/XSLT, lots of experimental HTML/CSS2 with MS SQL and we make a new database for a better performance.





The true about this, it's that this site will be released with lot of things to repair… and also some big usability errors, that’s because we don't have time to fix. The market and the investors want to get this out right now.
